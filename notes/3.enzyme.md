# Enzyme & Jest Testing (Basics)

## Docs

1. [Enzyme Docs](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)

2. [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/api)

## Pre Installation Notes from Course

1. On October 23, 2020, create-react-app updated to React 17. Since running npx create-react-app as recommended in this course will use the latest version of create-react-app, your apps will be using React 17 as well.

2. Unfortunately, the official enzyme-adapter-react-17 is not yet available. As of the March 2021 update, the course uses uses the unofficial @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 adapter. When the official adapter becomes available, I will update the course lectures to reflect this.

3. There may be some dependency issues when installing the unofficial adapter (or when making installs afterward). Running the install with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag should allow the install to continue.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
npm install --save-dev enzyme @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

1. The adapter helps translate react code to enzyme code.

2. Finally we setup Enzyme by configuring it with our adapter

   ```js
   import Enzyme from "enzyme";
   import EnzymeAdapter from "@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17";

   Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() });
   ```
