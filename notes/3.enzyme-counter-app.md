# Enzyme & Jest Testing (Basics)

## Docs

1. [Enzyme Docs](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)

2. [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/api)

## Pre Installation Notes from Course

1. On October 23, 2020, create-react-app updated to React 17. Since running npx create-react-app as recommended in this course will use the latest version of create-react-app, your apps will be using React 17 as well.

2. Unfortunately, the official enzyme-adapter-react-17 is not yet available. As of the March 2021 update, the course uses uses the unofficial @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 adapter. When the official adapter becomes available, I will update the course lectures to reflect this.

3. There may be some dependency issues when installing the unofficial adapter (or when making installs afterward). Running the install with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag should allow the install to continue.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
npm install --save-dev enzyme @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
#or
yarn add -D enzyme @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

1. The adapter helps translate react code to enzyme code.

2. Finally we setup Enzyme by configuring it with our adapter

   ```js
   import Enzyme from "enzyme";
   import EnzymeAdapter from "@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17";

   Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() });
   ```

## Testing Beginner: Simple Click Counter

A Simple App, with a button and counter display.

Clciking button Increses value in counter display.

## Setting Up our Tests

We are going to have 5 tests in total.
The first test is very generic.
The last one we want to think about. See the comments

```js
import Enzyme, { shallow } from "enzyme";
import EnzymeAdapter from "@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17";
import App from "./App";

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() });

test("renders without err", () => {});

test("renders increment button", () => {});

test("renders counter display", () => {});

test("counter display starts at 0", () => {});

// Here we will test that it increments the counter display,
// ie: test behaviour/functionality
// And NOT test the state,
// ie: that it increments counter state (implementation)
test("clicking button increments counter display", () => {});
```

## Data Test Attributes (DTA)

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div data-test=""></div>;
}
```

1. Data Test Attributes to test rendering

   1. Added to the top lvl element of a component

2. And if a component with that DTA gets rendered, our test passes

3. Why not just use id or class? Why new attribute?

   1. id and class have their own uses in a production app

   2. Which means they are more susceptible to change in case of refactor

   3. DTA is only for testing

   4. data-test is the conventional name for this attribute but you can choose any name

   5. Finally many people don't want DTAs in their production have. We will see how to remove them in production later.

4. Convention is to use `snake-case` or `kebab-case` for DTAs

5. Finding [DTA in a shallow wrapper using enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/find.html)

## Removing Data Test Attributes for Production

1. Need the following pacakge `babel-plugin-react-remove-properties`

   ```bash
   yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
   ```

2. NPM package for [babel-plugin-react-remove-properties](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-remove-properties)

3. `Optional step` if we are using create-react-app. Need to run the following. What it does is take the config files and makes it editable by us.

   ```bash
   npm run eject
   # or
   yarn run eject
   ```

4. This will change the `package.json` and add a bunch of configs there, but first it will ask me to commit my work, in case I want to revert back.

5. If I haven't commited my work, the command will `fail`

6. Once successful, it will unhide all the `configuration files` hidden by `create-react-app`, and make it available to me under the `/config` folder. Also the `package.json` will now be bloated.

7. Next we will `Update Babel Config` in the `package.json` file

8. Go to `Usage` section and copy the `with options` section minus the opening `{}` and put it in the `babel` section of `package.json`. We remove all the properties except "data-test"

9. The babel section looks as follows. Obvioulsy the opening and closing `{}` are not part of it. Just kept here for indentation in the markdown.

   ```json
   {
     "babel": {
       "env": {
         "production": {
           "plugins": [
             [
               "react-remove-properties",
               {
                 "properties": ["data-test"]
               }
             ]
           ]
         }
       },
       "presets": ["react-app"]
     }
   }
   ```

10. To test if it works, we `Create a production build` using

    ```bash
    npm run build
    #or
    yarn run build
    ```

11. Next we need to create a static server by running (the command line tells you this as well once you create the production build). Must be root user.

    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    # or
    yarn global add serve
    # and then
    serve -s build
    ```

12. Will have to restart terminal or jus run the command `bash`

13. Find out more about deployment here: [CRA deployment](https://cra.link/)deployment

14. Finally the production build is served in `localhost:5000` and we should see no data-test attributes in it

## Our First 3 Tests

This 3 tests simply check if the component is there, if any of the component disappear our test would fail

```js
test("renders without err", () => {
  // create shallow wrapper for APP
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  // find elements with the sepecified attribute
  const appComponent = wrapper.find("[data-test='app-component']");
  // find returns all elements that match
  //we should have exactly one match
  expect(appComponent.length).toBe(1);
});

test("renders increment button", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  const incrBtn = wrapper.find("[data-test='increment-button']");
  expect(incrBtn.length).toBe(1);
});

test("renders counter display", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  const cntDisplay = wrapper.find("[data-test='counter-display']");
  expect(cntDisplay.length).toBe(1);
});
```

### Refactor: DRY for the first 3 Test

The refactor is kinda ridiculous, but just to get into to better practice for future, also uses jsDocs.

> In the future we we will use a more complex `setup()` function to create a component with the desired state and props

```js
//JSDocs
/**
 * Factory function to create a ShallowWrapper for a component
 * @param {*} component
 * @returns {ShallowWrapper}
 */
const setup = (component) => shallow(component);

const findByTestAttr = (wrapper, val) => {
  return wrapper.find(`[data-test='${val}']`);
};

test("renders without err", () => {
  const wrapper = setup(<App />);
  const appComponent = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "app-component");
  expect(appComponent.length).toBe(1);
});

test("renders increment button", () => {
  const wrapper = setup(<App />);
  const incrBtn = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "increment-button");
  expect(incrBtn.length).toBe(1);
});

test("renders counter display", () => {
  const wrapper = setup(<App />);
  const cntDisplay = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "counter-display");
  expect(cntDisplay.length).toBe(1);
});
```

## Testing Strategies and Design Decisions

1. Testing Code and Production Code `do NOT have the same Goals`

2. Therefore Dry might not always be the best way to go

3. We want failing Tests to be easy to diagnose.

4. We do not want to go through a bunch of test files and helper files etc. Sometimes this means repeated Code.

5. For example we could have made a helper function for the following code. But that make diagnosis mre difficult. So it's ok to repeat code.

   ```js
   const wrapper = setup(<App />);
   const appComponent = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "app-component");
   expect(appComponent.length).toBe(1);
   ```

6. The `setup()` and `findByTestAttr()` functions are something we will be doing a ton. So helper for those are ok. And they are `not likely to be source of failure for our tests`

7. Find `Balance` between `DRY` and `easily diagnosed Tests`

8. Also we want our tests to be small and precise, we `DID NOT do something like this`

   ```js
   test("renders component and elements without err", () => {
     const wrapper = setup(<App />);

     const appComponent = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "app-component");
     expect(appComponent.length).toBe(1);

     const incrBtn = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "increment-button");
     expect(incrBtn.length).toBe(1);

     const cntDisplay = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "counter-display");
     expect(cntDisplay.length).toBe(1);
   });
   ```

9. If above test fails, hard to diagnose where it failed.

10. `Good Rule of Thumb:` 1 expect/assertion per test

    1. Test Descriptions provides better documentation

    2. Failure counts are more accurate (since tests stops at first failed assertion) and give better indication of state of code

11. However, If a bunch of tests require `similar setup`, we can use the `beforeEach()` function for common setup

## Test Initial Counter Display

1. Test text diplayed on page

   1. Not state value
   2. Testing behaviour, not implementation

2. The plan

   1. Counter value will be a `<span>`
   2. Give it a DTA `count`
   3. Test that value is initially `0`
   4. Next Test: simulating clicks

3. Use Enzyme's [.text()](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/text.html) method to test value within span

4. `Remember` that the `text()` function returns a string

Fianally, here is our test

```js
test("counter display starts at 0", () => {
  const wrapper = setup(<App />);
  const count = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "count").text(); //returns string
  expect(count).toBe("0");
});
```

## Test Button Click

1. The Plan

   1. Find the button
   2. Click the button
   3. Find the display Value
   4. Check the number in display matches

2. We will use the [simulate()](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/simulate.html) function from `Enzyme`

Finally the Test

```js
test("clicking button increments counter display", () => {
  const wrapper = setup(<App />);

  // 1. Find Button
  const incrBtn = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "increment-button");

  // 2. Click Button
  incrBtn.simulate("click");

  // 3. Find Value in Display
  const count = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "count").text();

  // 4. Check if number Increased
  expect(count).toBe("1");
});
```

### Some Tips

1. Don't `find` too early

   1. Elements are unreliable after wrapper has changed. For example we clicked the button first and then found the display

   2. We dont want to find the button, find the display and then click

   ```js
   // DO THIS
   const incrBtn = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "increment-button");
   incrBtn.simulate("click");
   const count = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "count").text();
   expect(count).toBe("1");

   // NOT THIS
   const incrBtn = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "increment-button");
   const count = findByTestAttr(wrapper, "count").text(); // BIG NO NO
   incrBtn.simulate("click");
   expect(count).toBe("1");
   ```
